The only thing this program does is to bounce the "Downloads" stack in your Dock.
Edit: It actually works with any file that is inside a stack, but the file can't live inside a subfolder.


I intend to use it to make rtorrent bounce the "Downloads" stack when a torrent has been finished.

Usage:
	BounceDownloadStack path to file

If something seems wrong, just contact me or comment or something :)
