This command line tool will make a stack in you OS X Dock bounce. My intended usage was to bounce the Downloads stack when a rtorrent download had finished, but I can imagine that it has other uses as well.

All credit goes to http://iloveco.de/quick-trick-bouncing-the-downloads-stack/ for the code.

Usage: BounceDownloadStack path
  path: must be an object in the toplevel of the stack folder
